# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis with Python, Power BI & Machine Learning

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of over 4,800 movies using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and integrates with Power BI and SQLite. It covers everything from data cleaning and visualization to basic machine learning and sentiment analysis.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze trends in movie revenue, genres, ratings, and director performance.
- Clean and merge multiple real-world datasets (movies + credits).
- Perform sentiment analysis on movie overviews.
- Predict whether a movie will be profitable using machine learning.
- Store and query the data using SQLite.
- Export data for dashboard creation in Power BI.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, ast, sqlite3, textblob, sklearn
- **Power BI**: for interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: for development
- **SQLite**: to store and query the cleaned dataset
- **GitHub**: version control and portfolio presentation

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Cleaned messy, nested data (like `genres`, `crew`, and `cast`)
- ✅ Extracted director names from JSON-style structures
- ✅ Analyzed top revenue-generating and profitable movies
- ✅ Created insightful visualizations (ratings, genres, profits)
- ✅ Applied sentiment analysis to movie descriptions
- ✅ Built a basic ML model (Random Forest) to predict movie profitability
- ✅ Exported and queried data using SQLite

## 📊 Visuals & Dashboard (Power BI)

Power BI dashboard ideas:
- Bar chart: Revenue by Genre
- Line chart: Ratings over the years
- Cards: Total Movies, Avg Rating, Total Profit
- Slicers: Filter by Genre, Year, Director

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.
3. Upload the two datasets:
   - `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
   - `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
4. Run cells one by one to:
   - Clean data
   - Visualize insights
   - Apply ML and sentiment analysis
5. Export data as CSV or store it in SQLite for further querying.

## 📎 Final Output

- `cleaned_movie_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset ready for Power BI or Excel
- `movies.db`: SQLite database
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)
